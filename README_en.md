this project was forked from [CorentinTh/it-tools](https://github.com/CorentinTh/it-tools)

## How to Develop and Deploy

### Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following extensions:

- [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur)
- [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [i18n Ally](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lokalise.i18n-ally)

with the following settings:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": false,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  },
  "i18n-ally.localesPaths": ["locales", "src/tools/*/locales"],
  "i18n-ally.keystyle": "nested"
}
```

### Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
   1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
   2. Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

### Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Create a new tool

To create a new tool, there is a script that generate the boilerplate of the new tool, simply run:

```sh
npm run script:create:tool my-tool-name
```

It will create a directory in `src/tools` with the correct files, and a the import in `src/tools/index.ts`. You will just need to add the imported tool in the proper category and develop the tool.
